# asteroids-game
Clone of Asteroids game made in Unity Engine
This project should some of my skills, i guess :)

Game code has next features:
1. MVP pattern used
2. Decoupled logic from MonoBehaviour
3. No default Physics engine used
4. Ð¡ustom collision system

Totally spent development time: 16 hours   
Still under development (don't have too much time to finish it :( )
